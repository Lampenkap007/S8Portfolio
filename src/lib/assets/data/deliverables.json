		"summary": "I conducted an available product analysis to find existing solutions on the problem statement for my project. These existing solutions can be used for inspiration in a later stage. I scalped the internet looking for interesting things that have anything to do with data visualization within sports. There are five products or concepts that I found that are interesting. <br><br> First, there’s a concept called digital twins. It is a broad term as it means that a digital twin is a digital version of something physical from the real world. However, it can also be applied to sports. I included this concept as I consider digital twins to be an interesting concept to apply in Formula 1. <br><br> Next, I found Unity’s Metacast. This is a variation of green screen technology, but with multiple cameras to create a 3D model of a moving object, MMA fighters in this example. Metacast provides a high-resolution model that allows for super detailed analysis of the sport. Of course, it’s not possible to wrap an entire Formula 1 track in green screen, but I included it as it might be interesting to use for parts of a race, like analyzing pitstops etc. <br><br> The videos of Formula Addict on YouTube are a great example of how 3D visualizations can be implemented in F1. This also allows for a more detailed analysis by fans. However, these videos are made after the event. I included this example because I am curious to see if it’s possible to automate this process or even present it live for the users. <br><br> F1TV Pro’s 2D visualization of track positions are a great example of data visualization within Formula 1. I included this example because I’m curious if a 3D variant of this product would add value for F1 fans. <br><br> At last, I included a little project called F1 Race Visualizer, this tool is built on the Ergast API that serves historical Formula 1 data. I included this tool as I found it interesting as it uses historical data instead of live-timing data, and I’m curious if historical data could also play a role in my project. <br><br> These five examples will be presented during the focus group discussion where we’re going to ideate the first idea’s as these examples will be a great source of inspiration during the brainstorming session.",

The answer for this question is required for the Double Diamond's ideation phase, where a solution for the problem statement will be defined. <br><br> This question will primarily be answered using library research. However, RacingNews already makes use of an API for Formula 1 data. This API is undocumented however, and not much can be found online about it. So information about this API will have to come from TDE itself.<br><br> Also, in this research, I'm also looking for data that could be interesting to visualize with ThreeJS. Think of GPS data of Formula 1 cars for example.<br><br> It seems like two types of data can be used for this project: live data and historical data. Further research will tell what data will eventually be used. However, it's good to know what data is available to get a better understanding of what's possible to build.<br><br> All three data sources found are interesting, although Fast-F1 is the most reliable data source, it cannot be used in the project, as it isn’t suitable for web applications. Ergast is unsuitable to use as well as it will probably shut down next year. This will result in an unsustainable product. The undocumented API is also risky to use as we don’t know what will happen with this data source in the future. However, this is the most promising data source for the project, as RN365 already uses this data source for their live timing data, and this data source also provides positioning data of Formula 1 cars.",

This topic falls in line with the general goal of this project, namely improving the F1 experience for viewers at home by creating more engagement. <br><br> According to BILUe, fan engagement in sports is an act of providing an end-to-end experience for a sports audience. This starts before a match, during a match and after a match. The ultimate goal is to have a more personal connection with the sport or brand. <br><br> This document provides a summary of a few findings that were found online. In the end it is concluded how this information can be useful for this project. <br><br> It turns out that fan engagement strategies can elevate the engagement between sports and fans. What’s interesting to take from these strategies is that it’s important to look for things like uniqueness, interaction and more options for analysis, as these things result into more engagement with sports fans.",

		"summary": "This project will involve multiple technologies that are new to me and some of them contain quite a steep learning curve. ThreeJS is probably the largest one. Fortunately, TDE has a course available that consists of about 80 hours of material. Next I'll write small summaries of technologies that I found during my research. In the end I'll conclude how these technologies could be useful for the project. <br><br> During my own TheeJS journey, I've heard multiple times that the possibilities are limitless. This of course doesn't mean much, but I found that TheeJS is quite capable. It's possible to visualize as much detail as you want, as long as the hardware is powerful enough. ThreeJS feels a bit like Unity3D but scaled down to fit in a web package. Therefore, it's certainly possible to build entire games with it, or make highly realistic digital twins of real-world items or environments. ThreeJS also supports physics, which allows for running simulations and more. <br><br> Next, there's React-three-fiber which is a front-end framework built to make integrating ThreeJS in React or Next much easier. <br><br> At last, Yuka is a library that might be really interesting for the general goal of this project; to visualize Formula 1 data in 3D. Yuka enables you to simulate vehicle behavior in a 3D web environment. This means it's also possible to simulate entire F1 races in 3D, based on timing data. <br><br>",

Therefore, I released a survey with the goal to identify target audience interests. <br> <br> In this document, I have summarized the survey questions and their respective responses and drew conclusions regarding topics to be discussed during the focus group discussion. These conclusions will be visualized in personas, empathy maps and customer journeys in the user-centered-design analysis. <br><br> Thanks to this survey we have a great input for the focus group. We now know that the 3D visualization tool will be a secondary source of information for people who follow Formula 1 and that users are primarily watching TV to follow an F1 race. Also, people don't make much use of second screens during a live race while they're watching the TV. This means that users have their mobile phones available for potential 3D visualizations. Next, users replay a race quite often. Which makes making 3D visualizations during a replay an option to consider. <br><br> Users find historical data more interesting than live timing data. But there's not much difference. Making a tool for comparing live timing data with historical data is considered to be not that interesting, but it might be interesting to add at a later stage. In addition, the tool will provide the ability to control the 3D visualizations with zoom, rotation etc and people have relatively fast internet so we don't have to be extremely careful with larger 3D models. Gamification will not be important for the project, however it might be interesting for further development at a later stage and users prefer a freemium model as a payment method. <br><br>",

If a user misses two laps of a race, and the entire driver standing changed, the user wants to know what happened. We want to solve this by making a timeline that automatically logs events like overtakes, safety cars etc. It's possible to filter by driver to personalize the timeline and keep it uncluttered. Each event has its own replay button that visualizes an overtake in 3D for example. This automated timeline can easily be integrated with the liveblog of RN365. This can be done in two ways; Liveblog items written by the RN365 editorial could be included in the timeline, but automated events can also play a role in the RN365 liveblog as a semi automated function that fills the liveblog.",

Therefore, Learning Outcome 2: Situation-Orientation applies. <br><br> During the formation of the idea, we took sustainable development into account. We agreed not to use the Ergast API, as it would result in a product that’s not sustainable because Ergast will shut down next year. Also, we took business into consideration. As the tool will be part of RN365’s premium subscription model. Therefore,  Learning Outcome 3: Future-Oriented Organisation applies. <br><br> This deliverable is a research method on ictresearchmethods.nl. and it is an effective approach to come up with an idea to further develop into a concept. The idea that resulted from the focus group discussion was validated by strategy expert Michiel and the entire concept was later validated by stakeholder Ruud. Therefore, Learning Outcome 4: Investigative Problem Solving applies. <br><br> I acknowledged that the time for this focus group would be really valuable and to make sure that I got what I needed, I took the lead in this meeting and gave structure by making sure everyone knew the objective, and explained that in the end, I would need an idea to further develop into a concept. Therefore, Learning Outcome 5: Personal Leadership applies <br><br> This meeting was attended by several partners that have a role in my project. I communicated appropriately to make sure the focus group had the right impact and execution. Therefore, Learning Outcome 6: Targeted Interaction applies.",
